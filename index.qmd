## ➊ AUTOBIOGRAPHY



## ➋ CREATIVITY POEM

::: {.point-seven-em .column width="60%"}
| From the shore of comfort, let creativity set asail,
| Towards the distant shore, where innovations unveil.
| Chart the surroundings, oh wandering ship,
| Without the guiding map, you'll stray and slip.
|
| Stay true to your goal, oh steadfast ship,
| Else, lost you'll be, in fate's ruthless grip.
| Fear not to err, oh brave bold ship,
| For without courage, your’ll remains adrift. 
|
| Steer by your moral compass, oh wise ship,
| Without ethics, you'll veer off and sink.
| With these in mind, let creativity set asail,
| In the end, triumph shall be your tale.
