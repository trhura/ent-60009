## ➊ AUTOBIOGRAPHY {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}
![](images/cover.png)
::: 

::: {.column width="65%"}
<b>The Ordinary Man</b>
<br/>

::: {.point-seven-em}
<b>Finding Happiness in Everyday Moments</b>

As a child, I loved reading biographies. They whisked me away from my mundane life into the fascinating worlds of others. Back then, I thought biographies were only about highly accomplished and famous people. But as I grew older, I realized that biographies are more about glimpsed through someone else's life and gaining wisdom from their experiences.

In this biography, you'll follow the story of an ordinary man who once chased greatness but eventually discovered that you don't need grand achievements to live a happy and fulfilling life. And that true happiness often lies in the simplest of things. Through his setbacks and triumphs, you will witness the beauty of embracing one's limitations and living simple, contented life. Ultimately, you'll come to understand it is not the destination that makes life fulling, but the journey itself.

| From the shore of comfort, let creativity set asail,
| Towards the distant shore, where innovations unveil.
| Chart the surroundings, oh wandering ship,
| Without the guiding map, you'll stray and slip.
|
| Stay true to your goal, oh steadfast ship,
| Else, lost you'll be, in fate's ruthless grip.
| Fear not to err, oh brave bold ship,
| For without courage, your’ll remain adrift. 
|
| Steer by your moral compass, oh wise ship,
| Without ethics, you'll veer off and sink.
| With these in mind, let creativity set asail,
| In the end, triumph shall be your tale.

## ➌ CREATIVITY & PAST EXAMPLE {.smaller}

:::: {.columns .point-eight-em}

While working at a major ISP in Myanmar, during covid, our home-visit physical bill collection halted due to government social distancing restrictions. We came up with an innovative solution: implementing digital bill collection through agents.

::: {.column width="100%" .point-seven-em}
* `Domain-relevant Skills`: The team possessed strong digital and tech skills crucial for this task.
* `Creativity-relevant Processes`: Creating an independent task force and using agile development methodologies accelerated our innovative solution.
* `Task Motivation`: The urgency of the situation, with the business at risk without a solution, provided strong motivation.
* `Social Environment`: The supportive work environment, including backing from executives and cross-teams, fostered creativity and collaboration.
::: 

This success story highlighted on how domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, task motivation, and a supportive social environment combined to enable innovative problem-solving under challenging circumstances.

## ➌ CREATIVITY & PAST EXAMPLE {.smaller}

:::: {.columns .point-eight-em}

At the same company, the CEO initiated a stregic effort strategic effort to reduce operational expenses during Covid economic downturn. However, this endeavor yielded poor results due to several factors:

::: {.column width="100%" .point-seven-em}

* `Task motivation`: Employees lacked motivation, as there was no incentive structure aligned with cost-cutting goals.
* `Domain-relevant Skills`: While the team possessed strong financial acumen, they lacked familiarity with the operations they were attempting to improve, hindering implementation.
* `Creativity-relevant Processes`: Rather than employing innovative approaches to reduce waste, the team focused on implementing typical frugal measures or cost controls.
* `Social Environment`: Despite encourangement from upper management, the majority of employees did not appreciate the efforts, leading to demoralization of the team and eventual failure of the initiative.

This story demonstrates how the lack of creative components can impede innovative problem-solving efforts, highlighting the significance of each component in Amabile's componential theory of creativity.

## ➍ CREATIVITY & EDUCATION


::: {.point-nine-em}
Creativity is "the process of having original ideas that have value".
:::

:::: {.columns }

::: {.column width="25%"}
![](images/boy.png)
:::
::: {.column width="75%" }
1. <b>Creativity is a process, not an event</b>.
<small>People often mistake "aha" moments as creativity, but it's an iterative process involving trial-and-error. It encompasses brainstorming, hypothesizing, and refining ideas until the desired outcome is achieved.</small>
<br/>

2. <b>Creativity can be taught. </b>
<small>While directly instructing creativity isn't possible, individuals' creative potential can be nurtured through opportunities, enablement, encouragement, and inspiration.</small>
<br/>

3. <b>Creativity can be assessed.</b>
<small> The claim that creativity can't be assessed stems from a narrow definition of creativity. Using Sir Ken Robinson's definition, creativity can be assessed based on originality and value within a specific field.</small>

## ➍ CREATIVITY & EDUCATION 



:::: {.columns }

::: {.column width="25%"}
![](images/girl.png){height=400px}

::: {.column width="75%" .point-seven-em}

* Creativity is a learnable skill deeply resonates with my personal experience. Raised in a structured asian culture and having a background in analytical engineering, I initially struggled with creative problem-solving at work & study.
<br/>

* However, over time, actively seeking out tools and techniques to enhance creativity, coupled with exposure to nurturing environments, have demonstrably improved my ability to generate new ideas.

>| Fostering creativity through the right conditions and practices can unlock potential for any person.

## ➎ CREATIVITY & SPACE TIME OASIS

Creativity is not a talent, but rather "a way of operating". 

:::: {.columns }

::: {.column width="50%" .point-nine-em}

* `Open mode` is a more relaxed & receptive state of mind. 
* Encourange exploration and allows creativity to flourish.
* Fosters an atmosphere of curiosity and playfulness.
* Emphasizes divergent thinking, generating many ideas.


::: 

::: {.column width="50%" .point-nine-em}
* `Closed mode` is the mode we are in most of the time.
* Focus solutions and getting things done.
* Requires attention to detail and problem-solving.
* It can be stressful and anxious and there is not much room for humor or play.

## ➎ CREATIVITY & SPACE TIME OASIS


:::: {.columns }

::: {.column width="50%" .point-eight-em}

* Personally, taking a stroll in a public space is the perfect way to trigger open mode. 
<br/>
* While many prefer absolute quiet and stillness, I need stimulating visual and audio input — not enough to disrupt, but enough to spark new connections.
<br/>
* Maybe, it's because, when I'm seated at my desk in my private room, I'm conditioned to operate in closed mode, prioritizing productivity and task completion.

::: 

::: {.column width="50%" .point-eight-em}

* One difficulty is finding a balanced physical surroundings, stimulating enough to encourage creativity, yet not so disruptive as to hinder focus. 
<br/>
* Another significant obstacle is my tendency to become easily content. This often leads me to stick to the initial solution without fully exploring alternatives, thereby hindering the emergence of more creative solutions.

## ➏ CONNECTING THE DOTS {.smaller}

I recently took up cooking to save money and found interesting parallels between cooking and startups.

:::: {.columns }

::: {.column width="50%" .point-nine-em}

* Both require proper `preparation` - gathering all the necessary ingredients for cooking, just like assembling the right team, funding, and resources for a startup. 

* Maintaining `balance` is key in both cases. Cooking needs the right measurements, while a business must balance the interests of different stakeholders — customers, employees and shareholders. 
::: 

::: {.column width="50%" .point-nine-em}
* `Timing` is crucial —  knowing when to add ingredients while cooking mirrors the timing of product launches, scaling efforts, and fundraising rounds in a business. 

* You often need to `adapt` to the available ingredients in cooking, much like entrepreneurs must adapt to evolving market conditions and competitive landscapes in business.

## ➏ CONNECTING THE DOTS 

Reflecting on this thought experiment:

:::: {.columns }
::: {.column width="75%" }
* To form such connections, first, you need to have the dots. That is to say, one needs to have a diverse array of experiences or cross-disciplinary knowledge to draw ideas or insights. 

* Secondly, you need the creative capacity to connect those dots — by stepping back and thinking broadly rather than narrowly focusing on immediate tasks at hand.

## ➐ CREATIVITY AND RISK {.smaller}

::: {}
* Creative pursuits inherently carry an element of risk. Creative individuals can effectively mitigate risks by starting small and working iteratively, which enables continuous feedback and course correction, ultimately increasing the chances of achieving the desired outcome.

* The risky nature of creativity should not deter individuals, as it can lead to groundbreaking results in their lives. As Robert Frost eloquently expressed in his poem "The Road Not Taken":

>| I took the one less traveled by,
>| And that has made all the difference.

## ➑ THINKING STYLES {.smaller}

* My thinking style is dominantly analytical and methodical reasoning, likely influenced by my engineering background.  Structured problem-solving and systematic analysis feel instinctive to me. 

* I also have a knack for generating creative and innovative ideas to some extent, thanks to my ability to approach problems from various angles and identify overlooked patterns and opportunities.

* However, I often struggle to envision grand, visionary concepts, often constrained by practical considerations. Also being a non-verbal thinker, expressing my ideas orally proves challenging, leading to lower scores in social and collaborative settings. 

::: footer
:::

## ➑ THINKING STYLES 

* Nonetheless, I am mindful of short-comings and actively seek out opportunities to overcome them. 

* I firmly believe that thinking styles are not static, but can be cultivated and enhanced over time through conscious effort. 

* More importantly, the challenge lies not in developing these thinking styles, but in recognizing when to leverage each thinking style based on the specific circumstances at hand.

## ➓ NEW INSIGHTS {.smaller}

* Although creativity is a desired trait, you should able to switch between different ways of thinking, depending on the situation or task. Sometimes, You might need to explore many possibilities (`divergent`), or approach a problem from a new angle (`lateral`). Eventually, you'll need to bring your ideas together (`converge`) to execute.

* Another controversial idea is that, during creative process, you should think whether it's worth spending extra time and effort. For example, if I put more work into this assignment, I could be more creative and get higher marks. But, there is decreasing marginal return with extra efforts, it might not be worth it in the end. It is important to do cost-benefit analysis and know when to stop.
